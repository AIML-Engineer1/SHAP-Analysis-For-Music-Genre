Red Bars (Positive SHAP Values)
Push prediction higher
Increase model output
Example from your plot:
harmony_var +0.13 → strongest positive contributor
rolloff_mean +0.08
spectral_bandwidth_mean +0.05
These features are increasing the model's prediction.

Blue Bars (Negative SHAP Values)
Push prediction lower
Decrease model output
Example:
tempo -0.05
mfcc16_mean -0.05
mfcc18_mean -0.02
These features reduce the prediction.

Tempo/BPM | sum(|SHAP|) @30s = 0.0412 vs @3s = 0.0236 due to noisiness from the clips, hence a lower absolute value for 3 seconds

At 30 seconds, KNN recognizes Country as rhythmic continuity.
At 3 seconds, KNN recognizes Country as spectral resemblance.

At 30s:
Genre is interpreted as temporal form.
The model recognizes:
Groove
Rhythmic pacing
Harmonic continuity

At 3s:
Genre is interpreted as spectral snapshot.
The model recognizes:
Frequency distribution
Attack characteristics
Timbral spikes

30s Summary Plot
Tempo high importance
Tight SHAP distribution
Harmonic averages matter

3s Summary Plot
Tempo low importance
Wide SHAP variance
MFCC variance and spectral spikes dominate
